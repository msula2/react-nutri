                                in a specific change in health; we say that a person has a deficiency of that
                                nutrient.
                                A lack of vitamin C, for example, can eventually lead to scurvy. A
                                diet with too little iron can result in iron-deficiency anemia. To complete the
                                definition of a nutrient, it also must be true that putting the essential chemi-
                                cal back in the diet reverses the change in health, if done before permanent
                                damage occurs. For example, if taken early enough, supplements of vitamin
                                A can reverse the effects of deficiency on the eyes. If not, prolonged vitamin
                                A deficiency can cause permanent blindness.
                                The six classes of nutrients, namely carbohydates, protiens, lipids, vitamins, minerals and water serve three general functions: 
                                They provide energy, regulate body processes, and contribute to body structures.
                                Since the body needs large quantities of carbohydrates, proteins, and
                                fats, they are called macronutrients; vitamins and minerals are called micronutrients
                                because the body needs comparatively small amounts of these nutrients`;

export const carbs_desc =   `Carbohydrates are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
                            and are a major source of fuel for the body. Dietary carbohydrates are the
                            starches and sugars found in grains, vegetables, legumes (dry beans and peas),
                            and fruits. We also get carbohydrates from dairy products and from fiber, a
                            type of carbohydrate that exists in plants. Your body converts most dietary
                            carbohydrates to glucose, a simple sugar compound that is found in the
                            bodyâ€™s circulation and provides a source of energy for cells and tissues. The
                            monosaccharide units that make up fiber molecules are not broken down by
                            human digestive enzymes. Fiber passes through the small intestine into the
                            large intestine, where bacteria metabolize some and some short-chain fatty
                            acids and gas are also formed. It is glucose that we find in circulation, or the
                            movement of substances through the vessels of the cardiovascular or lymphatic
                            system, providing a source of energy for cells and tissues.`;

export const protiens_desc = `Proteins are organic compounds made of smaller building blocks called amino
                            acids. Unlike carbohydrates and lipids, amino acids contain nitrogen as well as
                            carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Proteins are found in a variety of foods, but
                            meats and dairy products are among the most concentrated sources. Grains,
                            legumes, and vegetables all contribute protein to the diet, whereas fruits con-
                            tribute negligible amounts. The amino acids that we get from dietary protein
                            combine with the amino acids made in the body to make hundreds of different
                            body proteins. Proteins are the main structural material in the body. They are
                            also important components in blood, cell membranes, enzymes, and immune
                            factors.29 Proteins regulate body processes and can also be used for energy.`
