                                nutrient.
                                A lack of vitamin C, for example, can eventually lead to scurvy. A
                                diet with too little iron can result in iron-deficiency anemia. To complete the
                                definition of a nutrient, it also must be true that putting the essential chemi-
                                cal back in the diet reverses the change in health, if done before permanent
                                damage occurs. For example, if taken early enough, supplements of vitamin
                                A can reverse the effects of deficiency on the eyes. If not, prolonged vitamin
                                A deficiency can cause permanent blindness.
                                The six classes of nutrients, namely carbohydates, protiens, lipids, vitamins, minerals and water serve three general functions: 
                                They provide energy, regulate body processes, and contribute to body structures.
                                Since the body needs large quantities of carbohydrates, proteins, and
                                fats, they are called macronutrients; vitamins and minerals are called micronutrients
                                because the body needs comparatively small amounts of these nutrients`;

export const carbs_desc =   `Carbohydrates are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
                            and are a major source of fuel for the body. Dietary carbohydrates are the
                            starches and sugars found in grains, vegetables, legumes (dry beans and peas),
                            and fruits. We also get carbohydrates from dairy products and from fiber, a
                            type of carbohydrate that exists in plants. Your body converts most dietary
                            carbohydrates to glucose, a simple sugar compound that is found in the
                            body’s circulation and provides a source of energy for cells and tissues. The
                            monosaccharide units that make up fiber molecules are not broken down by
                            human digestive enzymes. Fiber passes through the small intestine into the
                            large intestine, where bacteria metabolize some and some short-chain fatty
                            acids and gas are also formed. It is glucose that we find in circulation, or the
                            movement of substances through the vessels of the cardiovascular or lymphatic
                            system, providing a source of energy for cells and tissues.`;

export const protiens_desc = `Proteins are organic compounds made of smaller building blocks called amino
                            acids. Unlike carbohydrates and lipids, amino acids contain nitrogen as well as
                            carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Proteins are found in a variety of foods, but
                            meats and dairy products are among the most concentrated sources. Grains,
                            legumes, and vegetables all contribute protein to the diet, whereas fruits con-
                            tribute negligible amounts. The amino acids that we get from dietary protein
                            combine with the amino acids made in the body to make hundreds of different
                            body proteins. Proteins are the main structural material in the body. They are
                            also important components in blood, cell membranes, enzymes, and immune
                            factors.29 Proteins regulate body processes and can also be used for energy.`

export const fats_desc = `The term lipids refers to substances we know as fats and oils but also to fatlike 
                        substances in foods, such as cholesterol and phospholipids. Lipids are organic
                        compounds and, like carbohydrates, contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
                        Fats and oils—or, more correctly, triglycerides—are another major fuel source
                        for the body. In addition, triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids have
                        other important functions: providing structure for body cells, carrying the fatsoluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), and providing the starting material (cholesterol) for making many hormones. Dietary sources of lipids include the fats
                        and oils we cook with or add to foods, the naturally occurring fats in meats
                        and dairy products, and some less obvious plant sources, such as coconut,
                        olives, and avocado.`

export const vitamins_desc = `Vitamins are organic compounds that contain carbon and hydrogen and perhaps
                            nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, or other elements. The main function
                            of vitamins is to help regulate many body processes such as energy production, blood clotting, and calcium balance. Vitamins help to keep organs and
                            tissues functioning and healthy. Because vitamins have such diverse functions,
                            a lack of a particular vitamin can have widespread effects. Although the body
                            does not break down vitamins to yield energy, vitamins have vital roles in the
                            extraction of energy from carbohydrate, fat, and protein.
                            Each of the 13 vitamins belongs in one of two groups: fat-soluble or
                            water-soluble. The four fat-soluble vitamins—A, D, E, and K—have very
                            diverse roles. What they have in common is the way they are absorbed and
                            transported in the body and the fact that they are more likely to be stored in
                            larger quantities than the water-soluble vitamins are. The water-soluble vitamins include vitamin C and eight B vitamins: thiamin (B1), riboavin (B2),
                            niacin (B3), pyridoxine (B6), cobalamin (B12), folate, pantothenic acid, and
                            biotin. Most of the B vitamins are involved in some way with the pathways
                            for energy metabolism. Vitamins are found in a wide variety of foods, not just
                            fruits and vegetables—although these are important sources—but also meats,
                            grains, legumes, dairy products, and even fats. Choosing a well-balanced diet
                            usually makes vitamin supplements unnecessary. In fact, when taken in large
                            doses, vitamin supplements (especially those containing vitamins A, D, B6,
                            or niacin) can be harmful.`

                            are components or cofactors of enzymes and are essential for enzyme activity and promoting various biochemical reactions. 
                            Iron is a component of hemoglobin and is responsible for transporting oxygen from the blood to various parts of the body. 
                            Minerals such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium are essential for the conduction of nerve signals and muscle contraction, 
                            including the proper functioning of the heart muscle. Minerals like zinc and selenium are important for maintaining normal immune system function and fighting disease. 
                            For example, iodine is an essential element for thyroid hormone synthesis and is critical for regulating metabolism, growth, and development. 
                            Certain minerals are involved in regulating the pH value in the body and help maintain acid-base balance. 
                            The impact of minerals on human health is comprehensive and multifaceted. Deficiency or excessive intake of certain minerals may lead to health problems. 
                            It is important to maintain a balanced diet and make sure you are getting enough minerals from a variety of foods.`

export const water_desc = `Water plays a variety of vital roles in the human body. Water is the main component of the body,

                            saliva, and other body fluids. Through sweating and breathing, water participates in body temperature regulation, 
                            helping the body dissipate heat when the heat is too high and maintaining a stable body temperature. Water acts as a solvent in the blood, 
                            helping to transport nutrients, oxygen, and hormones to various parts of the body. Water participates in the digestive process, 
                            helping to break down food so the body can absorb nutrients, while also facilitating the passage of food debris through the intestines. 
                            Water is the main way to remove waste from the body through urine, sweat and stool, helping to remove toxins from the body. 
                            Water provides lubrication to joints and soft tissues, helping to reduce friction and keep joints flexible. Adequate hydration keeps skin moist, 
                            elastic and healthy-looking. Water participates in chemical reactions within cells, is part of the cell's structure, and is vital to the cell's survival and function.
